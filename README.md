# TopologyRuleMustNotOverlapWithLine

This rule is useful for lines that should never occupy the same space with lines in another layer. The lines must not overlap any part of another line.

For example, is useful when you are planning to build a way, this one can cross to rivers or water courses but the way can not overlap with the river segment.
